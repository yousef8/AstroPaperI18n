# AstroPaper with I18n

- This repository is a fork of the [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) theme, enhanced to support internationalization (i18n).

- I18n integration is implemented using [Astorjs i18n routing](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/internationalization/)

- As I'm a native Arabic speaker, I made sure the i18n integration supports RTL languages (etc Arabic, Persian,...).

- If god wills, the branch will maintain synchronization with the original [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) theme.

- Does not modify the original themeâ€™s UI; it solely adds i18n support.
